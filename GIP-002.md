What we are doing:

- Allow users to compound wealth while still giving to their favorite orgs
    - Users select which % of profits goes to charities
    - Tax breaks will also be an incentive
- Onboarding charities into DeFi
    - Helping them get set with an ETH wallet and get valuable funds to people that need them

**GIVE Protocol Litepaper**

**Abstract:**

GIVE Protocol was developed under the assumption that DeFi is a fair, innovative, and secure means to accumulate wealth. We have seen [rapid growth in DeFi](https://decrypt.co/51015/2020-has-been-chainlinks-year-heres-why) over the past few months, but have yet to see funding reach organizations that need it the most. GIVE Protocol aims to bridge the gap between DeFi and charitable organizations by trustlessly allowing users to give a percentage of their yields to a nonprofit of their choice.

GIVE Protocol aims to empower existing users of DeFi to consider charitable donations as an integral aspect of their financial growth. GIVE Protocol will also focus on being a user-friendly bridge to existing philanthropy by connecting existing donors to the exceptional interest rates in DeFi. Through this initiative, GIVE Protocol firmly believes that it can onboard thousands of new DeFi through a lossless donation stream, without having to reduce their base capital.

**GIVE Protocol:**

GIVE Protocol is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by GIVE token holders. Through the permissionless and open-source nature of DeFi, GIVE Protocol plans on being built on top of [Rari Capital](https://www.rari.capital/), a well-known and audited capital management platform. Funds deposited through GIVE Protocol will be then deposited into Rari Capital, but will have a set percentage of all yields earned routed to the wallet address of the charitable organization of their choice. The GIVE token will be distributed to all users who deposit through GIVE Protocol in order to fairly distribute governance control of the DAO.

**Tokenomics:**

The GIVE token will be fork of the [SUSHI token](https://dev.sushi.com/sushiswap/contracts) due to its battle-tested security and synergistic fee distribution to xSUSHI holders. The biggest difference between SUSHI and GIVE is that the fee distribution for staked GIVE, or xGIVE, will be a result of interest earned from underlying yields, instead of swap fees as xSUSHI is designed to receive.

- Forked off of Sushi Governance token
- Stake Give to receive xGive, an interest bearing governance token that is rewarded with some of the protocol's profits.
- Multisig with AJ, Teddy, and maybe 3 other trusted community members
- Vote on Charity options, adding underlying protocols, changing revenue structure

Security:

GIVE Protocol relies heavily on the underlying contracts of Rari, which have been audited by Quantstamp. We will leave further security measures up to the DAO to propose and vote through. We have seen similar projects create an insurance fund through Nexus and Cover once they reach a certain size. Furthermore, we will work towards getting our contracts audited once they are live.

Chainlink Questions:

- How can we use the new APR oracle feed?
- Can we use CL oracles to set up donations with existing payment rails for donations (like Red Crossâ€™ website)?
- How can we be transparent about where the money is going so people feel like they are not being scammed?
- How can we help people get tax benefits from donations?

Chainlink Use:

- Wallet addresses, info about charities.
