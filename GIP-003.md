# Keep3r Use case in the context of Give Protocol

Once the give protocol goes live, there will be a 'yield aggregator donation' address managed by the Yeild generation contract which keeps accumulating the funds collected through interest.

The transfer of interest from the Yeild generation contract to the "reserve" address managed by the Give Governance contract will be triggered by external events:

1) Voting by Governance members for approval of fund transfer
2) Periodically keep checking for the accumulation of interest and only transfer funds to the reserve if the gas price is below a certain threshold.

# Rationale for leveraging Keeper in Give protocol

Ofcourse this can be acheived by a script that we call periodically. The script has to be intelligent enough to submit a transaction to the network only when the gas fees are low over a period of time.

The other option is to leverage the keep3r job framework to acheive this outcome.

# High level Workflow 

1) Connect to existing Keeper network in a test environment
2) Implement a GiveProtocol `Job` that satisfies the UseCase specification/requirements
2) Register the GiveProtocol `Job` through either Keep3r Governance or by calling `addLiquidityToJob(address,uint) on the Keep3r contract`
3) Identify the `credit` (in keepr terms) that needs to be rewarded to the keepers to perform the job. 

# Tasks
1) Find out how to setup a local development environment for keeper
2) If 1 is not possible, find out how to interact with a Keeper contract in test network
3) Implement keep3r `Job` for Giveprotocol spec fund transfer from Yeild generation contract to "reserve" address managed by governance
4) Work with Chainlink team to understand the Chainlink keep3r integration.
