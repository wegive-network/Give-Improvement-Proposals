# Abstract

Money, education and wealth are some of the foremost enablers of upwards mobility. The Give protocol provides the opportunity for under-privileged communities to pursue their dreams while not worrying about their ability to pay for their needs while chasing their dreams. The give protocol enables this by forwarding the interest accrued over Defi protocols on the wegive.network platform to sponsor an individual or donor organization in need there by enabling low-income communities' capacity to aspire, to build socio-emotional skills, and, ultimately, to pursue economic opportunities. Well you may think, interest accrued would be a small fraction. We argue that even fractions speak louder than words. 

# Background

We believe access to a free and open financial system is a basic human right. Out of over 7.5 billion people in this world, over 2 billion people have no access to financial services. It is very important to note that most of them have no knowledge of alternative ways of fund raising that exists in other parts of the world or have access to very expensive local cash loans provided at interest rates higher than 100 percent. Money has a different value depending on the part of the world it is located. The give protocol is a research oriented decentralized autonomous organization that hopes to connect people and donor organizations with necessary financing to improve the standard of living of the recipients. The give protocol encourages users of the platform to indulge in incentivized group savings schemes and have a profitable investing for themselves while also enabling and incentivizing them to donate a percent of their earned interest for charitable activities. We believe the give protocol holds the promise for generating more sustained long-run impact in the communities it is adopted. 

# Goals

The Give protocol would facilitate a multi-faceted economic inclusion program which aims to improve participation in income-generating activities, raise earnings while also facilitating economic diversification through donations. 

1. Encouraging individuals to save their hard earned money and who are interested in donating to the needy without losing their savings
2. Incentivise Individuals who are willing to donate with prizes and other value added services
3. Onboard a new generation of users to blockchain who are not just interested in riding on speculation of Tokens value but people who are non-technical should be able to use the platform.
4. Giving with dignity - Enabling donations to individuals while also protecting recipients  privacy
5. Create a new revenue stream for donations which is different from existing models of donations.
6. Build the best tools to enable charity at Global scale
7. The give protocol team will be engineering and research focussed and work on the long term vision of building a more equitable world

### Non-Goals

To narrow the scope of what we are working on, here are a few things which we won't be focussing:

- The goal of the project is not spend too much time in unethical token related activities that only focusses on the marketing the Give protocol without really solving the core problems pledged to solve in the first place.
- The give protocol team will not engage in rumours, drama and speculation and instead focus on building a product that is historic in this space.

# Proposed Solution

## **Decentralized Identity for Beneficiaries**

The recipients of funds will be onboarded into the [wegive.network](http://wegive.network) using a user-friendly decentralized identity solution which empowers the users to manage their own credentials in a privacy preserving manner. Our team believes the DECO and CanDID work from Chainlink is an ideal solution for our use case. At a high level, the requirements that need to be satisfied for the give protocol users are:

1. Users control ownership of their private data
2. Solve the chicken and egg problem that exists in the current credential issuance ecosystem. We think existing solutions are not scalable and are not built for the edge.
3. Sybil attack resistant
4. Credential revocation for misbehaving users/ banned organizations
5. Lost Key recovery feature for recipients

Since DECO/CAN DID is still not available to public yet, we will be leveraging existing DID solutions (open item needs some investigation).

## **Quadratic funding Protocol**

Quadratic funding is an idea proposed by Vitalik and it is an elegant mathematical solution for solving the problem of funding of public goods in a continuous, permission-less basis. Quadratic funding is a mathematically optimal way to allocate funds for the public goods. Projects like Gitcoin are already experimenting with it. This idea is not a perfect solution and is also prone to various sybil attacks. Projects like Q2T solve this problem by leveraging a DID solution and a 2 step quadratic distribution model and distribute funds based on milestones achieved by beneficiaries. We will be working towards a similar approach to solving the distribution of funds in a sybil resistant manner.

## Giveconomics

The funds deposited through Give Protocol will be deposited into one of the existing interest generating DeFi protocols like Rari Capital which is an open source capital management platform. A percentage of yields earned will be routed to the community approved charity organizations of their choice. The GIVE token will be distributed to all users who deposit through the GIVE protocol in order to fairly distribute governance control of the DAO. 

[https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/credit-delegation) - This would be a nice feature to have for the usecase we are targetting.

**Open Questions:**

1. Does RARI support credit delegation feature like AAVE today?

## Digital Public Goods Standards

The Give protocol will be aligning itself to the [Digital Public Goods Standard Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) and make every attempt to follow the broader guidelines set forth by Digital Public Goods Standards Alliance. 

## Leveraging Paystrings

PayString protocol designed makes it easy to send someone money as it is to send them an email. The addresses are human-readable addresses to transmit value. The PayString network allows participants to reach one another through standardized addresses.

## Potential Partnerships ideas

Chainlink

Rari Capital

NGO's

PayString.org

## Roadmap

- Give Protocol should support payments to communities or individuals who has just a mobile phone with SMS enabled and has no smart phone.
- Research on Cash Transfer vs Cryptocurrency transfer and its impact.
- Can we do a controlled study of the impact of Cryptocurrency transfer to people's holistic well-being?
- How would a periodic transfer of donations look like in the context of Give protocol?
- Should we prioritize verticals to onboard that will receive donations? For example Education, Environment etc.
